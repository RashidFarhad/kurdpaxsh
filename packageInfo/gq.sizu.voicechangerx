Again, for the first time ever!</strong> <br> <br> - Use system voices like Siri's to talk to the other party! VoiceChanger recognises your speech during a call, and speaks what it recognised using a Siri Voice instead of yours! You can also listen to what it says to the other party to ensure the recognition was correct. <br> <strong>Note:</strong> This feature requires an internet connection for the speech recognition and just like in Dictation or Siri, the speech data is sent to Apple to be recognised.<br> <br> <strong>Works for telephony calls, FaceTime, Messenger, Viber, Skype, WhatsApp and all other CallKit compatible apps</strong><br> <br> This awesome tweak changes your voice when you talk on the phone so that the other party hears your voice sounding like a Dark Lord, a Smurf or..a Chipmunk.<br> <br> - The audio process is being done live while you speak!<br> <br> - You can switch between normal speech or effect-altered speech live while you are in a call. New in-call UI allows you to change your voice pitch live, and even a slider has been added for manual pitch setting. The UI is customisable to appear at the top or bottom of the screen for your convenience.<br> <br> - You can also enable/disable the tweak while in a call.<br> <br> - There are <strong>5 different preset voices</strong>, but you may also <strong>set a custom pitch yourself!</strong><br> <br> - Now with Siri Voice option!<br> <br> - The best prank for your friends and family, they won't even recognise who they are speaking with!<br> <br> - Already compatible with CallBar X, AudioRecorder 2 and AnsweringMachine X.<br> <br> - All iOS 11/12/13 devices are supported.<br> <br> Enjoy!<br> <br> Configure options from Settings.",
